# WackAMole 2.0
## Description
This web browser based game offers a simple Whack-A-Mole user experience. Gather points along the way and try to get the highest score! Birthday moles give more points but the evil mole will take them away.
## Usage

## Technical Features
### Version 1:
Easy to use UI/UX built with the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The game itself uses a number of JS functions to set a game timer, populate a mole at a set increment and count the points on click. The points are stored in local storage and returned on the page. 
### Version 2:
Updated UI to be responsive for an optimized mobile browser experience. Added a randomizer to the moles. Added 3 more moles for a more engaging experience.
